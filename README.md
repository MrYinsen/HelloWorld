# Hello World!
This is repository of some introductory, exploratory projects I'll be working on to learn C++.  

For each project I will include a brief description next to the name of the script file. Generally the executable 
of a script file can will have the same name as the script with the exception of lowercase first letter. 
The bulk of these projects will be from the C++ textbook _C++ Primer_.  

ðŸ“œ__Scripts__:  
**HelloWorld.cpp**: output "Hello World" to console.  
**Addition.cpp**: accept to integers in CLI and output their sum.
