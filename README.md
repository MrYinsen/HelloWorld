# Hello World!
This is repository of some introductory, exploratory projects I'll be working on to learn C++.  

For each project I will include a brief description next to the name of the script file. Generally the executable 
of a script file can will have the same name as the script with the exception of lowercase first letter. 
The bulk of these projects will be from the C++ textbook _C++ Primer_.  

ðŸ“œ __Scripts__:  
[HelloWorld.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/HelloWorld.cpp): output "Hello World" to console.  
[Addition.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/Addition.cpp): accept to integers in CLI and output their sum.
