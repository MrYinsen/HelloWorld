# Hello World!
This is repository of some introductory, exploratory projects I'll be working on to learn C++.  

For each project I will include a brief description next to the name of the script file. Generally, the executable 
of a script file can be found in the bin folder and will have the same name as the script with the exception of lowercase first letter. 
The bulk of these projects will be from the C++ textbook, _C++ Primer_.  

ðŸ“œ __Scripts__:  
[HelloWorld.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/HelloWorld.cpp): print "Hello World" to console.  
[Addition.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/Addition.cpp): accept two to integers in CLI and print their sum.  
[Multiplication.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/scripts/Multiplication.cpp): accept two integers in CLI and print their product.  
[SumTwo.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/scripts/SumTwo.cpp): accept two integers in CLI and print the sum of all values between the two, inclusive of the final value.  
[Countdown.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/scripts/Countdown.cpp): accept an integer and print a countdown to 0 (inclusive).  
[Range.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/scripts/Range.cpp): accept two integers and print all the numbers in the range between them (inclusive).  
[SumArbitrary.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/scripts/SumArbitrary.cpp): accept an arbitrary amount of integers and print the sum of all input integer values.  
[ConsecutiveValues.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/scripts/ConsecutiveValues.cpp): accept an arbitrary amount of integers and print the size of each run of consecutive integers.  
[TypeConverter.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/scripts/TypeConversion.cpp): play with implicit type conversions.  
[EscapeSequence.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/scripts/EscapeSequence.cpp): basic printing using escape sequences.
[ReferencesIntro.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/scripts/ReferencesIntro.cpp): trying out reference compound type.  
[PointersIntro.cpp](https://github.com/MrYinsen/HelloWorld/blob/main/scripts/PointersIntro.cpp): explore basic methods to assign values to pointers. Change the value at the pointer address and initialize new values using the dereference operator on the pointer.
